# GET STARTED TO CTF

## What is CTF ??
CTF stands for "Capture The Flag," which is a type of cybersecurity competition where participants solve various challenges to obtain flags (strings of text) that represent a piece of sensitive information. These challenges typically involve cryptography, reverse engineering, web exploitation, binary exploitation, forensics, and other aspects of cybersecurity.

CTF competitions can be organized by universities, government agencies, private companies, or independent groups, and they are often used as a way to train and test the skills of cybersecurity professionals, students, and enthusiasts. CTFs can be played individually or in teams, and they can range in difficulty from beginner-level to highly advanced.

Participating in CTFs can be a fun and rewarding way to develop and showcase your skills in cybersecurity, as well as to learn from others and build connections within the community.

## Type of CTF 
- <b>Jeopardy-style CTF</b>: This is the most common type of CTF competition where participants solve challenges from different categories such as cryptography, reverse engineering, web exploitation, binary exploitation, and forensics. Points are awarded for each challenge, and the team with the most points at the end of the competition wins.
 
 - <b>Attack/Defense CTF</b>: In this type of CTF competition, each team has its own set of servers and services that they need to protect while simultaneously trying to hack into the other teams' servers and services. Points are awarded for both attacking and defending, and the team with the most points at the end of the competition wins.
 
 - <b>King of the Hill CTF</b>: In this type of CTF competition, teams compete to maintain control of a central server or system. The team that can maintain control of the server for the longest period of time wins.
 
 - <b>Mixed CTF</b>: This type of CTF competition combines elements of the other three types, and can include challenges from different categories, as well as an attack/defense or king of the hill component.
 
 CTF competitions can also be categorized based on their level of difficulty, with some competitions aimed at beginners and others designed for more advanced participants.
 
 ## Scoring Type
 - <b>Jeopardy-style CTF Scoring</b>: Each challenge is assigned a certain number of points based on its difficulty, with harder challenges being worth more points. Teams earn points for each challenge they solve, and the team with the most points at the end of the competition wins.

- <b>Attack/Defense CTF Scoring</b>: Points are awarded for both attacking and defending. Each team has its own set of servers and services that they need to protect while trying to hack into the other teams' servers and services. Points are awarded for successful attacks and for successfully defending against attacks.

- <b>King of the Hill CTF Scoring</b>: Points are awarded for maintaining control of the central server or system for the longest period of time. The team that can maintain control of the server for the longest time wins.

- <b>Mixed CTF Scoring</b>: Mixed CTF competitions can use a combination of the above scoring systems, with challenges from different categories, as well as an attack/defense or king of the hill component.

It's worth noting that CTF organizers can use different scoring systems, and they may modify the rules of the game to suit the competition's goals and objectives.

## CTF CHALLENGES TYPE

There are various types of challenges in a CTF competition. Here are some of the most common challenge types:

- <b>Cryptography Challenges</b>: These challenges involve decoding or decrypting messages, cracking ciphers, or breaking codes.
- <b>Reverse Engineering Challenges</b>: These challenges involve analyzing and modifying binary files, firmware, or hardware components to reveal hidden information.
- <b>Web Exploitation Challenges</b>: These challenges involve exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or command injection.
- <b>Binary Exploitation Challenges</b>: These challenges involve exploiting vulnerabilities in binary files, such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or heap-based buffer overflows.
- <b>Forensics Challenges</b>: These challenges involve analyzing data from file systems, network traffic, memory dumps, or other sources to extract hidden information.
- <b>Steganography Challenges</b>: These challenges involve finding hidden messages or data in images, audio files, or other multimedia.
- <b>Programming Challenges</b>: These challenges involve solving problems using programming languages or scripting languages.
- <b>Miscellaneous Challenges</b>: These challenges can include a wide range of tasks, such as solving puzzles, cracking passwords, or performing social engineering attacks.

CTF organizers can also create custom challenges or mix and match challenge types to create a unique and challenging competition.

# Approach to ctf

Here are some general tips for approaching a CTF competition:
- Understand the Rules: Before the competition starts, make sure you understand the rules and scoring system. Knowing the rules and objectives of the competition can help you focus your efforts and develop a strategy.

- Build a Team: Participating in a CTF competition with a team can be more effective than doing it alone. Find teammates with complementary skills and work together to solve challenges.

- Start with the Easy Challenges: Start by solving the easier challenges first to gain confidence and build momentum. This will also help you learn about the types of challenges you can expect in the competition.

- Keep Good Notes: Keep notes on the challenges you've solved, the tools and techniques you've used, and the things you've learned. This can help you solve similar challenges in the future and improve your skills.

- Collaborate and Ask for Help: If you get stuck on a challenge, don't be afraid to ask your teammates or other participants for help. Collaboration and knowledge sharing are important aspects of CTF competitions.

- Use Available Tools and Resources: Take advantage of the tools and resources available to you, such as online documentation, forums, and tutorials. These can provide valuable insights and tips for solving challenges.

- Stay Focused and Manage Your Time: CTF competitions can be intense and time-limited, so it's important to stay focused and manage your time effectively. Prioritize the challenges you want to solve and allocate your time accordingly.

Remember, CTF competitions are designed to be challenging, and even experienced participants may not solve every challenge. So, don't get discouraged if you encounter difficult challenges, and use the competition as an opportunity to learn and improve your skills.
